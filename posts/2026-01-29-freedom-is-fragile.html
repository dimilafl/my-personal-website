        Most people think I started Wall Street Silver because I liked the metal. But if you want to know the real reason, the engine that actually drives me, you have to go back further than the subreddit. You have to go back to my roots.
      </p>

      <h2>The "North Korea of Africa"</h2>
      <p>
        My mother grew up in Eritrea, a country often called the "North Korea of Africa." It is a place where freedom is a myth and economic self-determination is non-existent. Growing up with her stories, I learned a hard lesson very early on: Economic freedom is not the default setting of the world. It is an anomaly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I watched as many of my peers in the West took this for granted. They assumed that property rights, sound money, and the ability to build wealth were guaranteed. But I knew better. I knew that when the state controls the money, the state controls the people.
      </p>

      <h2>My Libertarian Awakening</h2>
      <p>
        This realization is what led me down the rabbit hole of libertarian philosophy. It wasn't just about "lower taxes" for me; it was about the fundamental morality of a free market. I realized that true liberty is impossible without financial liberty.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2017, while serving as Chapter President for Young Americans for Liberty at Boston College, I attended the organization's national convention. It was during this gathering that I had the distinct opportunity to meet Senator Rand Paul, a figure who has consistently fought against the erosion of our liberties.

      <p>
        Seeing figures like him in the political arena cemented something in my mind: we cannot just sit on the sidelines and hope the government does the right thing. Because usually, they won't.
      </p>

      <h2>The Rise of Socialism in America</h2>
      <p>
        Today, that fight is more urgent than ever. We are watching a disturbing shift in the American political landscape. Figures like Bernie Sanders and Zohran Mamdani are gaining a real foothold, pushing policies that sound compassionate on the surface but ultimately hand more power to the state.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are seeing a generation being sold the lie that more government control is the solution to our economic woes. They are being told that the way to fix the system is to print more money and centralize more power. Coming from a family that escaped a command economy, I see the red flags that others miss.
      </p>

      <h2>Democratizing Sound Money</h2>
      <p>
        This is why I founded Wall Street Silver, and why I fought to secure the trademark. I wanted to build a vehicle that could push back not just with arguments, but with action.
      </p>

      <p>
        I realized that the best way to fight the encroachment of socialism isn't just to debate it, but to democratize sound money.
      </p>

      <p>
        They want to print fiat? We stack silver. They want to centralize wealth? We teach the masses how to be their own central bank. They want to control the narrative? We build a community that values truth and due diligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wall Street Silver is my contribution to the fight for economic freedom. It is my way of ensuring that the "North Korea" style of economics never gains a permanent foothold here. We are arming the average person with the most powerful weapon against tyranny: Honest Money.
